```

**Comparison Table:**

| Feature | BM1 | BM5 |

**When to Choose BM1:** New to agency accounts, single brand, cost-effective entry, testing strategies.

**When to Choose BM5:** Multiple ad accounts, higher spending limits, different niches/brands, agency infrastructure.

**Pro tip:** Start with BM1 to test creatives/targeting. Once you find winners, upgrade to BM5 to scale aggressively.

```yaml
title: "5 Strategies to Scale Meta Ads Without Getting Banned"
description: "Proven techniques for scaling your Meta advertising campaigns while maintaining account health and stability."
date: "2026-02-18"
author: "GoAds Team"
tags: ["Scaling Tips", "meta", "strategy"]

**Why Accounts Get Banned:** Spending increases >50% day-over-day, restricted categories without auth, low-quality landing pages, multiple accounts from same IP.

**Strategy 1: Warm Up New Accounts (7-Day Protocol)**
- Day 1-2: $50/day, broad targeting
- Day 3-4: $100/day, refine audiences
- Day 5-6: $200/day, proven creatives
- Day 7+: Increase 20-30% per day

**Strategy 2: Diversify Infrastructure** — Multiple accounts across BMs.

**Strategy 3: Monitor Health Daily** — Morning: quality score, policy warnings, cost trends. Evening: delivery status, rejected ads, spend pacing.

**Strategy 4: Quality Creative Assets** — Original content, minimal text in images, landing page matches ad promise.

**Strategy 5: Work With Verified Providers** — Pre-warmed accounts, higher limits, better stability, 7-day warranty.

## Post 6: Ad Account Health Scores

date: "2026-02-20"
author: "GoAds Team"
tags: ["BM Guides", "account health", "best practices"]
published: true
```

**Health Score Factors:** Policy compliance rate, user feedback signals, landing page experience, payment history.

**Key Advice:** Avoid sudden spend spikes, keep rejection rate <5%, respond promptly to policy notifications. Single violation doesn't permanently damage — Meta uses rolling window. Recovery: compliant ads at lower budgets for 2-3 weeks.

## Post 10: CBO Optimization

```yaml

description: "Master CBO strategies to maximize ad spend efficiency."
date: "2026-02-08"
author: "GoAds Team"
tags: ["Scaling Tips", "optimization", "CBO"]
published: true
```

**When to use CBO:** 3-5 ad sets, similar audience sizes, 50+ conversions/week, conversion-focused objective.

**Setup:** Min $100/day budget, use minimum spend limits sparingly, allow 3-7 day learning phase.

**Common Mistakes:** Too many ad sets, vastly different audience sizes, frequent edits resetting learning, not enough time.
