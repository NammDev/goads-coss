| What payment methods do you accept? | Stripe, PayPal, bank transfer (Wise, IBAN), and cryptocurrency (Bitcoin, USDT). |

| What support after purchase? | Fast response via Telegram, WhatsApp, or Discord. Real humans who know your order. |
| Why are BM5 accounts more expensive? | BM5 accounts have run campaigns successfully = higher trust with Meta. More trust = more stability = higher price. |
