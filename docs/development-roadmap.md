## Backlog (2027+)

Deferred features — revisit when business scale requires them.

| Feature | Reason for deferral |
|---------|---------------------|
| Telegram Bot (notifications) | 1-on-1 chat with customers works fine at current scale |
| Payment integration (SePay/Stripe) | 1-on-1 customer care for now, manual flow |
| Auto-delivery pipeline | Depends on payment integration |
| AI Ask (RAG) | Future — manual support preferred currently |
| Tool tiers (free/pro) | Not needed at current scale |
| Bulk order API | Enterprise feature, no demand yet |
| Referral/Affiliate | Growth feature, premature at this stage |
