# Phase 2 — Auth Migration + Core Business Flow

> Goal: Smooth, clean admin→customer flow. No more, no less.

**Core flow:** Super admin creates user → topup → create order → deliver → Customer logs in, sees balance, orders, products, can purchase from portal.

---

## Execution Strategy

**Step 1:** Clerk migration on main branch (Critical Path — blocks profile, performance, E2E)
**Step 2:** After Clerk merged, split remaining work into 3 parallel worktrees
**Step 3:** E2E testing after all worktrees merged

```
Phase 1: [████████ Clerk migration ████████]  ✅ DONE (main branch)
                                              ↓ merge
Phase 2: WT-A: [██ Tables + Toast + Polish ██]     (parallel)
          WT-B: [██ Portal catalog + Profile ██]    (parallel)
          WT-C: [██ Perf + DX + Admin pages ██]     (parallel)
                                              ↓ merge all
Phase 3: [██ E2E testing ██]
```

## Tasks Overview

### Step 1 — Clerk Migration (main branch, sequential)

| # | Task | Priority | Status | Description |
|---|------|----------|--------|-------------|
| 1 | Clerk migration | Critical | ✅ | Thay Better Auth bằng Clerk — ClerkProvider, sign-in/sign-up pages, requireRole(), server actions, webhook sync, edge middleware |

### Step 2 — Parallel Worktrees (after Clerk merged)

#### WT-A: `ui-tables-toast-polish`

| # | Task | Priority | Status | Description |
|---|------|----------|--------|-------------|
| 10 | Pixel-perfect shadcn studio tables | Medium | ⏳ | Refactor AdminDataTable dùng trực tiếp code shadcn studio — chỉ swap data/columns, giữ nguyên UI gốc |
| 5 | Error handling UX | Medium | ⏳ | Thêm toast cho tất cả actions (thành công/thất bại). Hiện im lặng khi lỗi |
| 7 | Flow polish | Medium | ⏳ | Xử lý edge cases: balance=0, stock=0, duplicate delivery, empty states |
| 8 | Cal.com embed | Low | ⏳ | Gắn widget đặt lịch gọi vào `/talk-to-sales` |

**File ownership:** `components/dashboard/admin-data-table.tsx`, `*-table.tsx` wrappers, column defs, toast components, empty state components, `/talk-to-sales`

#### WT-B: `portal-catalog-profile`

| # | Task | Priority | Status | Description |
|---|------|----------|--------|-------------|
| 3 | Portal product catalog | High | ✅ | Dashboard → Shop. Reuse ProductCard + Card3D từ marketing. DB products + customer pricing. Category filter tabs. |
| 4 | Portal profile | Medium | ✅ | Clerk `<UserProfile />` (avatar, name, email, password, MFA, sessions). ProfileDropdown wired real Clerk data + sign-out. Deleted custom profile-form. |
| 13 | Portal tools integration | Medium | ✅ | All 20 marketing tools mirrored into portal via React context (ToolPageShell adapts to portal/marketing). Sidebar "Tools" group with 3 category collapsibles (Security, Data Processing, Utilities) + Extensions. BM extension moved to `/portal/tools/extensions`. |
| 14 | Portal search | Medium | ✅ | Cmd+K search dialog wired to real DB — debounced server action searches orders, products, wallet via ILIKE. Static portal pages always visible. |
| 15 | Public share links | High | ✅ | Admin generate/revoke share token from order detail. Public `/share/[token]` page with marketing layout (PageHero + bento CTA + order detail). Auth-aware: anonymous sees signup CTAs, owner sees "View in Portal". |

**File ownership:** `portal/products/*` (catalog view), `portal/profile/*`, `portal/tools/*`, `portal/search/*`, `app/share/[token]/*`, cart logic

#### WT-C: `perf-dx-admin-pages`

| # | Task | Priority | Status | Description |
|---|------|----------|--------|-------------|
| 6 | Dashboard performance | High | ✅ | Parallel queries, loading.tsx skeletons, auth cache(). All routes < 100ms DB time. See `plans/260313-1805-dashboard-performance/` |
| 2 | drizzle-kit push fix | High | ⚠️ Upstream | Root cause: Supabase auth/realtime CHECK constraints crash drizzle-kit parser (v0.31.9 bug). Added `schemaFilter: ["public"]` as best practice. Workaround: use `generate` + `migrate` instead of `push` |
| 11 | Admin finance page | Medium | ✅ | Real revenue by product type, top customers, order status breakdown, 3 charts (bar/donut/area). See `plans/260313-1843-admin-finance/` |
| 12 | ~~Admin settings page~~ | Medium | ➡️ Phase 3 | Deferred — depends on Telegram bot (3B) + notification system (Phase 4) |
| NEW | Perf measurement & audit | Medium | ✅ | Measured all 21 routes, all DB queries < 100ms. Added missing loading.tsx for products routes. See `plans/260314-dashboard-perf-measurement/` |

**File ownership:** `loading.tsx` files, `page.tsx` query optimization, `drizzle.config.ts`, `admin/finance/*`, `admin/settings/*`

### Step 3 — E2E Testing (after all worktrees merged)

| # | Task | Priority | Status | Description |
|---|------|----------|--------|-------------|
| 9 | E2E testing | Low | ⏳ | Test toàn bộ flow 2 role (super_admin + customer) sau khi mọi thứ xong |

## Dependencies

```
Task 1 (Clerk)  ──BLOCKS──→ Task 4 (Profile needs Clerk user object)
                            Task 6 (Performance: edge middleware)
                            Task 9 (E2E needs stable auth)

WT-A (UI)       ──NO DEPS── can start immediately after Clerk merge
WT-B (Portal)   ──NO DEPS── can start immediately after Clerk merge
WT-C (Perf/DX)  ──NO DEPS── can start immediately after Clerk merge

All WTs merged  ──BLOCKS──→ Task 9 (E2E runs last)
```

## What's Already Working

- Admin: create customer, topup, create order, deliver ✅
- Portal: dashboard, orders, delivered products, wallet ✅
- Auth: Clerk fully integrated (ClerkProvider, edge middleware, webhook sync, role guards) ✅
- Products: ~8 types, ~5-6 variants each — managed directly in DB, no admin UI needed ✅

## What's Missing (this plan covers all)

- ~~Auth: Clerk migration~~ ✅ Done
- ~~Portal: no product catalog in dashboard~~ ✅ Done (Shop page with ProductCard + Card3D, category filter tabs, customer pricing)
- ~~Portal: profile page incomplete~~ ✅ Done (Clerk `<UserProfile />`, ProfileDropdown wired with real Clerk data)
- ~~Portal: tools page not wired~~ ✅ Done (20 tools + extensions in portal via context-based shell, categorized sidebar nav)
- ~~Admin: finance page empty~~ ✅ Done — real queries + data tables
- Admin: settings page — deferred to Phase 3
- UX: no toast notifications on actions
- ~~DX: drizzle-kit CHECK constraint bug~~ ⚠️ Upstream bug — workaround: `generate` + `migrate` instead of `push`
- ~~Performance: dashboard routes lag 1-2s~~ ✅ Done — all routes < 100ms DB, parallel queries, loading skeletons, auth dedup, perf audit complete
- ~~Portal: no search across portal routes/content~~ ✅ Done (Cmd+K search with real DB queries)
- ~~Portal: no public share links~~ ✅ Done (token-based `/share/[token]` with marketing layout + conversion CTAs)
