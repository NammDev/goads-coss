## [2026-03-19] — Phase 6 Community Foundation (DB + API)

### Added
- **Community DB schema** — 7 new tables: `community_category`, `community_post`, `community_reply`, `community_upvote`, `community_report`, `community_view`, `community_subscription`
- **2 new enums**: `community_post_status` (8 values: open/solved/closed/in_review/planned/in_progress/completed/rejected), `community_report_reason` (spam/inappropriate/offtopic/other)
- **Extended `notification_type`** with `community_reply` + `community_solution`
- **9 query functions** (`community-queries.ts`): getCategories, getPosts (paginated), getPostBySlug, getPostsByAuthor, getMostHelpful (leaderboard), getPostStats, getReports, searchPosts
- **12 server actions** (`community-actions.ts` + `community-admin-actions.ts`): createPost, updatePost, deletePost, createReply, markSolution, toggleUpvote, toggleSubscription, recordView, reportContent, reviewReport, togglePin, updatePostStatus
- **8 default categories seeded**: Announcements, Q&A, Tips & Strategies, Showcase, Feedback, Troubleshooting, General, Introductions
- **Auto-subscribe**: post authors + repliers auto-subscribed for notifications
- **Notification integration**: subscribers notified on new replies, reply authors notified on solution mark

### Design Decisions
- Foreplay FeatureBase style: upvote-only (no downvotes), status badges, post card with vote count
- Vercel Community style: flat replies (no nesting), open/solved/closed lifecycle, minimal layout
- Denormalized counts (upvotesCount, repliesCount, viewsCount) for performance
- Separate admin actions file to keep files under 200 LOC
