### Refactored
- Split 3 large components into sub-modules (Plan 10)

- Replaced hardcoded colors with semantic CSS tokens (Plan 8)
- DRY marketing pages — CTA to layout + product page template (Plan 7)
- Removed unnecessary `use client` directives + fixed simpleicons remotePattern (Plan 6)

### Architecture Decisions
- Tailwind CSS v4 with oklch color tokens (over v3 hex)
- shadcn/ui + shadcn-studio blocks (over custom components)
- Static generation (over SSR) — no runtime server needed
- Single `globals.css` for all tokens (over component-scoped CSS)
- Data layer in `src/data/*.ts` (over CMS or API) for Phase 1
