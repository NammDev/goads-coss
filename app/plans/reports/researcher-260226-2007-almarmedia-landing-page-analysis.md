## Key Observations for Competitor Build

1. **Dark-only design** — no light mode toggle. Consistent green accent throughout.
2. **Multiple CTA entry points** — nav, hero, comparison section, final block (4+ touchpoints).
3. **Dual social proof strategy** — star rating/logos early (Section 3) + full testimonials mid-page (Section 10) + secondary carousel near bottom (Section 14).
4. **Comparison table as conversion lever** — placed after features, before testimonials. High-intent section.
5. **Platform-tabbed pricing** — Facebook / Google / TikTok tabs reduces cognitive load while showcasing breadth.
6. **Conditional contact form** — WhatsApp/Telegram field reveal reduces friction and qualifies lead intent.
7. **Two "how it works" sections** (4 and 11) — one generic (likely template remnant), one product-specific. Redundant; only one needed.
8. **Trust badge grid** (Section 16) appears AFTER the final CTA — likely used as a confidence layer before FAQ.
9. **FAQ placed last** before footer — standard objection-handling placement.
10. **Fonts:** Instrument Sans + Inter family — clean, modern, SaaS-standard choices.

## Unresolved Questions

- Section 4 ("Start Your Journey with Bemine") appears to be unreplaced template copy — unclear if intentional or oversight.
- Section 6 benefits copy ("Foster Collaboration", "Streamline Communication") also appears to be generic template — not ad-account-specific. May be intentional brand positioning or a build artifact.
- Dashboard section (Section 8) — unclear if an actual screenshot/UI mockup image is present; fetch returned text-only.
- Wyler Wilcher testimonial content (Section 10, card 8) — not captured in fetch.
- Exact green hex code for accent color not confirmed — approximated from description.
- Section 14 (secondary testimonials) may be the same component as Section 10 with different data, or a separate widget — unclear from fetch.
